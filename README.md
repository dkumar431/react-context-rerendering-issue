Hi Priyanka,

Officially I will be completing my notice period on 4th May, 2021.  But It would be a great help if you could try to reduce it by 1 week and make 28th April, 2021 as my last day with TCS. I will make sure that by this date I will do the complete knowledge transfer to the responsible person. 

Thanks,
Virag
